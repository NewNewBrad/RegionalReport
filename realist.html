    <p>The Syrian civil war shows monay instances of realism defining nations actions. </p>

    <h3>Sryrian Kurds take advatage of power imbalance.</h3>
    <p>With the Iragi government losing signifigant territory to ISIS, and the Syrian civil war creepong ever closer, Syrian Kurds and taking advantage of the chaos to for their own govenments and even a constitution. While officially recognizing this Rojavan government comes with plenty of diplomatic trouble, the US and Russia are both happy to continue supporting their cause with Weapons, Ammo, and logistics.
    </p><p>
    	More than once the Kurds have been used by a foreign power to fight in the region, only to be denied help with the backlash comes.

    <p>With every battle won and border expanded, the dream of Rojava becomes more real. As long as the YPG remains the only local force having success against ISIS, World powers with continue to back them, and slowly come around to the idea that the peace solution involves autonomy for the Syrian Kurds.</p><br>
    
    
    <h2>Why is the US involved?</h2>
    <p>With ISIS' rapid expansion into Iraq, and then into Syria, the US was responsible for some of the chaos in the region. As the US had only pursued arming local forces on the ground to no success, US power in the region began to slip.</p>

    <p>The United States has only <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/case-and-against-realist-strategy-syria">limited leverage</a> over Syrian and foreign players. U.S. diplomacy in dealing with Syria has failed to the point that the United States has become more of an observer than a player, and its attempts to create moderate Arab rebel forces have only been successful in creating Syrian Kurdish forces that may be useful in fighting ISIL, but help divide the country. The United States can scarcely hope to negotiate some form of rebel unity—before, after, or if the ISIL caliphate is defeated and dispersed—or even be certain the United States can avoid serious future clashes between Syrian Kurdish fighters and the Turks.</p>
   
     <h2>Russia protecting interests and pushing it's influence</h2>

      <figcaption>Russian made SU-35 for sale to Assad's forces.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Russia's goals in the region are driven by the loss of influence by the US and increase in the need to fight ISIS. Russia is trying to maintain its relaptionship with Assad in order to get back on good terms with other hard line dictators in the area. When the Kurds of Rojava defied odds and presented a unified front, Russia has supported this as a way to further drive US/Turkish relations negativly. </p>
    <p>Russia would like to see stability in the region, even if it means propping up dicators, because "in many parts of the world, states are far more fragile entities than most Western thinking has assumed. Very often, regimes and states are one and the same thing, so that if you bring down one, you also destroy the other. The consequences of this - especially in an era of international terrorists seeking safe havens in ungoverned territories - may be much worse than leaving a dictatorship in power." - <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/10/putin-shows-realism-syria-151013102705917.html">Aljazeera</a></p>
