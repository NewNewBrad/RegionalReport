   <h2>The Assad regime</h2>

    <p>After coming to power under pretense of being a democratic reformer, Assad was condemned by the US and the EU after being implicated in a series of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25189834">warcrimes.</a>
    </p> 
    
    <p>Kurds had expierienced harsh discrimination during the administration, but did not rush to demonstrate during the inital civil rebellion. </p>
    <p>
    	"DAMASCUS // As Syrian protesters battle to overthrow President Bashar Al Assad, the country's large Kurdish minority is struggling to decide if its interests lie in the fall of the regime or in its survival.

		Politically divided and uncertain about their future, Syria's two million Kurds, 10 per cent of the population, have played a limited role in the uprising, analysts, activists and Kurdish groups say."

    <h2>US influence in the region</h2>
    <p>The US has been arming and training various groups in the region for some time, in effort to fight against ISIS. After a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33997408">botched $500 million dollar effort</a> to arm and train 'moderate rebels', the US is pivoting their strategy to work predominantly with the Kurds of Northern Syria.</p>

    <p>Speaking to <a href="http://aranews.net/2016/05/us-repeats-not-recognize-kurdish-local-administrations-syria/">ARA News</a>, Faysal Itani, a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, said that the US just want to use the Kurds to fight against the Islamic State (IS), also known as ISIS. 
	“The reason is the US has a Syria policy and an ISIS policy and they’re not the same thing. The US is not interested in involving itself in Syria’s future and the Kurds’ place in it. This is too politically and strategically messy. They are just interested in the Kurds’ military utility against ISIS,” Itani said.</p><br>
     <h2>Russia, long time supporter of Assad regime.</h2>
    <figure class="floatleft"><img src="images/Putinassad.jpg">
      <figcaption>Putin showing he sticks by his friends.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Russia has been a long time supporter of Assads'. Syria has been their longesst standing ally in the region, despite alleged warcrimes by Assad forces. Russia would like to prove to the rest of the region that they stay true to their friends.</p>
    <p>Russia has however warmed up to the Kurds and Rojava, having all but promised them their autonomy. </p>
    "In some form or other, they will get their statehood — sooner or later," a member of the Russian Presidential Commission on Interethnic Relations told <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/russia-syria-iraq-kurds-quest-autonomy.html">Al-Monitor.</a>
    
    
    <p>In <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/07/putins-russia-is-wedded-to-bashar-al-assad-syria-moscow/">"Why Putin Is So Committed to Keeping Assad in Power"</a> - ForeignPolicy.com,  Churkin said he would leave it to policymakers back home to calculate Russia’s national interests.</p><br>
    <blockquote>"From a personal standpoint, he said, he considered it a matter of national honor to stand up for Russia’s friends. “We are stronger on our allegiances than others, I think, and this is being recognized internationally,” he said. “Being a Russian diplomat, for us, if you have good relations with a country, a government, for years, for decades, then it’s not so easy to ditch those politicians and those governments because of political expediency.”</blockquote>

     <h2>Turkey</h2>
    <p>After many years of friendly co-operation US and Turkey relations have been strained over the issue of the Kurds. Turkey has a long a violent history with the Kurdish people. There have been numerous innsurgencies since the end of WWI and war from 1982 to 1999.</p>
    <p>Turkey is opposed to any type of Kurdish autonomy or self governence, and is it at odds with its allies, who are now arming the YPG.</p>

    <p>Iran currently views the Syrian governmant as an important ally and "counter balance" to Isreal in the region. The two countires have a defense pact to protect against what they called the <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2006/Jun-16/72583-iran-and-syria-sign-pact-against-common-threats.ashx#axzz2tsRyr16V">"common threats"</a> presented by Israel and the United States. </p>
