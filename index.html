    <h2><strong>Northern Syria</strong><br> Autonomous region, or anarchy?</h2>

      <figcaption>Rojava, or Western Kurdistan, is a de facto autonomous region consisting of the 3 cantons of Afrin, Jazira and Kobani.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Rojava - renamed  the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria is regarded by some as one of the 4 parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan">Greater Kurdistan</a>, which also includes areas of Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Near the end of World War I, the allies unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the division of territories within the former Ottomen empire. What was to become Kurdistan was annexxed by turkish forces under the control of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who would later become the first president of modern Turkey.</p>
    <p>Rojava is a <em>de facto </em> autonomous region because it is not officially recognized be the Syrian governemnt, the US, NATO, or any other international state.</p>
    <p>The Kurds have been repressed, often violently, by the governments in the region. 1979 saw the Ayatollah Khomeni declare jihad against sepratist Kurds in Iran, <a href="http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/publications/reports/3508-haunted-memories-the-islamic-republics-executions-of-kurds-in-1979.html?p=35">occupying cities and putting thousands up for summary trials and quick excecutions.</a> </p>

    <p>The Kurds of Turkey have argued for autonomy, or greater political and cultural rights for Kurds inside the Republic of Turkey. From 1978 to 1999 the <a href="http://www.pkkonline.com/en/">PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party</a> waged an insurgent war against Turkish forces. The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by the NATO and the EU, however the US continues to have <a href="http://cabinet.gov.krd/a/d.aspx?s=040000&l=12&a=45402">dealings</a> with the group.</p>

    <h2>Kurdistan in the global arena.</h2>
    <p>While no official governing body recognize the North Syria as an independant nation state, major world powers have, and continue to have internation relations with the region.</p>

    <p>The US has quietly been <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/04/23/306233248/cia-is-quietly-ramping-up-aid-to-syrian-rebels-sources-say">arming and training what they call 'moderate rebels' to fight back ISIS in Syria</a>, but these rebels are also aligned against the Assad regime. While the US offers plenty of military support, they do not currently support a serperate autonomus region for them</p>
    <p>Russia, however, supports the region politically, <a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/02/12/russias-kurdish-card-in-syria/">demanding their inclusion in Geneva peace talks.</a></p>
    <blockquote>"Russia has called for the inclusion of the Kurds in the expected Geneva talks later this month, after their exclusion in previous rounds of both Geneva and Astana talks.

    Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that his country is trying to bring the Kurds and the Syrian regime to a common ground aimed at preserving the unity of the country."<br>
