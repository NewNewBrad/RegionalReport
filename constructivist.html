       <h2>Religious sects influence the region's decision makers.</h2>

    <p>While Realist thoery would argue that states war with each other becuase it is inevitable without proper deterrents in place, constructivism would argue that the societies cultural values and norms may have played a prominent role in decieding policy. The area of Rojava is in the middle of a regional crossroads, conquered and fought over for thousands of years. That few people in these regions know any type of sustained peace, how can they effectivly broker such a deal.</p>
    <p>Iran and Iraq are both comprised of a predominantly, Shiite majority, while Saudi Arabia and Syria are predominatly Sunni. This however does not always translate to friendly relations, as Syria and Iran have close ties after fighting together in the Iran-Iraq war.
    </p>
    <p>Turkey and Iran both oppose Rojava and the formation of a Kurdish State. Iran allows the Kurds in Iran a semi-autonomous region while Turkey is embroiled in a bitter war with its own Kurdish population. Realist explanations offer that these powers oppose Kurdish statehood simply because they would lose power in the region if the Kurds where united. Constructivism would say that these groupd would probably be fighting, even if their goals did align, simply because that has become the cultural norm.</p>
    <p>"The interactions between agents (individuals, non-state actors, states) take place in a social, historical and cultural context that Constructivism calls structure, and the relationship between agents and structure is one of co-constitution: the actions of the agents influence the structure and the structure in turn (re)defines identities and interests of the agents. Once constructed, identities and interests shape the agents’ actions thus making of international politics the result of a <a href="https://gpswithmarta.wordpress.com/an-analysis-of-the-syrian-conflict-through-the-lenses-of-realism-and-constructivism/#_ftnref15">continuous process of social interaction.</a>"</p>
    
    <h2>The Arab Spring, a new sense of self</h2>

    <p>With globalization, social interactions with the west, and market upheavel, The Arab Spring ushered in a new sense of self across the region, as people began to make more demands on their governments. "Confronted with a changing structure in which people were moved by new ideas, Assad also built a new self-identity – that of a legitimate ruler determined to stay in power against the threat posed by an “other” regarded as a group of dissidents, terrorists and state enemies. The national identity the Syrian people had constructed at the beginning of the protests, when they were calling for a new national order, left thus the place to identities that became ever more sectarian along religious and ethnic lines, and that explain the increasing fragmentation of the Syrian opposition. The anti-Assad faction was no longer constituted by a united people, but rather by a growing number of groups that perceived themselves as either “Sunni”, “Islamists”, or “Kurds”, and regarded the “other” – respectively – as an “Alawiite”, “Kafir”, or “Arab” enemy to overthrow.  Moved by these new sub-national identities, that often posed the different opposition groups one against the other, people entered new inter-subjective relationships that contributed to the collapse of the structure into a civil war ever more sectarian and ever more based on the Sunni-Shia, secular-Islamist, and Arab-Kurd cleavages."<br><i><a href="https://gpswithmarta.wordpress.com/an-analysis-of-the-syrian-conflict-through-the-lenses-of-realism-and-constructivism/#_ftnref15">"An Analysis of the Syrian Conflict through the Lenses of Realism and Constructivism"</a></i></p>

    <h2>Why the Rojava Revolution is different.</h2>
    <h3>Abdullah Ocalan and a new ideology.</h3>
     <figure class="floatright"><img src="images/ocalan.jpg">
      <figcaption><a href="https://peaceinkurdistancampaign.com/resources/abdullah-ocalan/">Abdullah Öcalan</a> is regarded by millions of Kurds as their political representative, and has become the key figure in their struggle for democracy.</figcaption></figure>
    <p>Society in Rojava is defined by the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/kurds-rojava-syria-isis-iraq-assad/505037/">principles of democratic confederalism</a> as established by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), now the largest constituent in a governing coalition titled the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM). Power is as decentralized as possible, rising up from village assemblies and communes to the legislative councils and commissions that run the economy, defense, and justice ministries. At all levels, the ethnic and gender balance is zealously asserted. Arabs, Yazidis, and Turkmen participate in the public sphere alongside the Kurdish majority, while the mantra of Rojava as a whole is “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” (“Woman, Life, Freedom”).</p>
    <p>According to Janet Biehl, who was part of an academic delegation to the Cizîre canton in December 2014, the district commune is the building block of the whole structure. Each commune has 300 members and two elected co-presidents, one male, one female. Eighteen communes make up a district, and the co-presidents of all of them are on the district people’s council, which also has directly elected members. The district people’s councils decide on matters of administration and economics like garbage collection, heating-oil distribution, land ownership, and cooperative enterprises.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/democraticconfederalism .jpg"><figcaption>Democratic confederalism - Once championed by Thomas Jafferson, is now alive and well in Rojava</figcaption></figure>
    <p>While all the communes and councils are at least 40 percent women, the PYD—in its determination to revolutionize traditional gender relations—has also set up parallel autonomous women’s bodies at each level. These determine policy on matters of particular concern to women, like forced marriages, honor killings, polygamy, sexual violence, and discrimination. Since domestic violence is a continuing problem, they have also set up a system of shelters. If there is conflict on an issue concerning women, the women’s councils are able to overrule the mixed councils.</p>

    <p> “The solutions for all social problems in the Middle East should have woman’s position as focus. . . . The role the working class have once played, must now be taken over by the sisterhood of women.” This is an amazing statement for a former Marxist guerilla; only the most radical of Western feminists would even dare to propose it." - <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-revolution-in-rojava">DissentMagazine.com</a></p>
